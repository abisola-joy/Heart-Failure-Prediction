# Heart Failure Prediction and Analysis
## Introduction:
Heart failure (HF) is a critical health condition where the heart fails to pump blood effectively, leading to severe health implications. To address this issue, the SHU clinic team has tasked us with exploring programming and analytics techniques to analyse and evaluate heart failure prediction models. Our goal is to make informed decisions on patient survival by leveraging machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques. The project involves the use of custom modules, function definitions, file processing, exception handling, scientific computing, data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

## Key Tasks:

-**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conduct EDA to identify and handle missing data, perform data preprocessing, and analyse descriptive statistics. Visualize data dependencies through various plots and draw conclusions.

-**Classification I**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets, then fit machine learning algorithms including Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest classifier, K-Nearest Neighbour, and Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Networks. Evaluate model performance using test data and report accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score.

-**Classification II**: Investigate class imbalance problem and apply techniques to balance class distribution. Build classification models using machine learning algorithms with the balanced dataset and compare performance metrics with Classification I.

-**Feature Selection**: Analyse feature significance using statistical tests like Mann-Whitney and Chi-Square tests. Rank features based on significance and plot feature importance graph from Random Forest Classifier to aid in feature selection.

-**Classification III**: Utilize selected features to build classification models using machine learning algorithms. Evaluate model performance and compare results with previous classification tasks.

This project aims to utilise advanced programming and machine learning techniques to contribute to the prediction and analysis of heart failure cases, facilitating better decision-making in healthcare.
